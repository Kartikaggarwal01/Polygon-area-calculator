# Polygon Area Calculator

A tiny Java Swing app that starts with a square and lets you drag its four vertices to reshape the polygon. It live-updates area, side lengths, and interior angles.

## Use it

- Start screen: click “NEXT” (or wait a few seconds) to open the canvas.
- Canvas: drag vertices (A, B, C, D) to reshape the polygon.
- Top label shows area and angles; side lengths are shown near midpoints.
- RESET: reinitialize using the bottom “Required Side Length” value (defaults to 250).
- GO BACK: return to the start screen.
